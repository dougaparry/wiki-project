# Wiki Journey

This project was part of a university assignment to create a wiki like website on a theme of our choice. My group decided to create a travel website to meet this brief. The website was created using Python, with Django as a webframework as well as the usual CSS, HTML and some JavaScript.

## Features:

The wiki software permits new pages to be created by anyone, both registered users and anonymously, and then edited by registered users only. The software permits users to signup and then perform edits according to their username. Anonymous users have a suitable anonymous username (e.g., their IP address).

Each page consists of a title, content (in a markdown-like syntax, rendered as HTML) and an author and zero or more editors. Each time a page is edited, the revision is be stored to permit rollback to an earlier version 

Extras included in the project include: user management and profiles, media uploading and embedding, access control on pages, URL based article creation.
